# Hungry Philosophers

## Description
This is a project representing the dilemma that face five philosophers that have to share chopsticks with their neighbors (not covid friendly). The philosophers are seated in a circular table where are placed five chopsticks, each one located between two philosophers. The problem is that the philosophers can eat their delicious rice when they have the two chopsticks in their hand.
